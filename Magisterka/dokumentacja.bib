  abstract = {The Rust programming language is lauded for enabling fearless concurrency with zero cost: detecting concurrency errors at compile time. Given the enduring difficulty of parallel programming in other languages, this implied panacea warrants analysis. In particular, the efficacy of Rust across types of parallelism remains unexplored. Is parallel programming always devoid of fear with Rust? We answer this question through a case study, porting 14 benchmarks with abundant regular and irregular parallelism from C++ to Rust and reporting our experience and observations. We find that Rust, with the Rayon library, indeed delivers fearlessness for program phases comprising only regular parallelism, e.g., prefix-sum. However, for applications with any irregular parallelism, the programmer must choose between unsafe code or high-overhead dynamic checks with errors that manifest at run time, leaving the arduous task of parallel programming as scary with Rust as with its predecessors.},

JOURNAL = {Electronics},

ABSTRACT = {Rust is a relatively new programming language that aims to provide memory safety at compile time. It introduces a novel ownership system that enforces the automatic deallocation of unused resources without using a garbage collector. In light of Rust’s promise of safety, a natural question arises about the possible benefits of exploiting ownership to ensure the memory safety of C programs. In our previous work, we developed a formal ownership checker to verify whether a C program satisfies exclusive ownership constraints. In this paper, we further propose an ownership-based safe memory deallocation approach, named SafeMD, to fix memory leaks in the C programs that satisfy exclusive ownership defined in the prior formal ownership checker. Benefiting from the C programs satisfying exclusive ownership, SafeMD obviates alias and inter-procedural analysis. Also, the patches generated by SafeMD make the input C programs still satisfy exclusive ownership. Usually, a C program that satisfies the exclusive ownership constraints is safer than its normal version. Our evaluation shows that SafeMD is effective in fixing memory leaks of C programs that satisfy exclusive ownership.},
