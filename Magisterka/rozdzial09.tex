The option of developing new computer languages may be the clean- est and most efficient way to provide support for parallel processing. However, practical issues make the wide acceptance of a new computer language close to impossible. Nobody likes to rewrite old code to new lan- guages. It is difficult to justify such effort in most cases. Also, educating and convincing a large enough group of developers to make a new lan- guage gain critical mass is an extremely difficult task.
